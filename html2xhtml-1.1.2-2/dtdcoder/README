*** DTDCoder

This is the program that extracts automatically the data encoded in
the XHTML DTDs. It creates the files 'dtd.c', 'dtd.h', 'dtd_names.c' y
'dtd_names.h'.

New DTDs can be added (or removed) editing the DTD
index file "dtd_index.xml" and adding the necessary template file.

*** Dependencies

- An internet connection, because the program downloads automatically
the DTDs listed in "dtd_index.xml".
- A Java JDK (1.5 or later).

*** Using the Makefile:

A copy of the four autogenerated files is already distributed in
the source code directory. They can be generated again executing
"make dtdlib" from this directory.

*** Invocation:

The program can also be executed manually:

java DTDCoder <index_file> <output_directory>

Example:

java DTDCoder dtd_index.xml ../src
