					 <p>Chip placement in a reticle is crucial to the cost of a multiproject wafer run. In this article we develop several chip placement methods based on the volume-driven compatibility optimization (VOCO) concept, which maximizes dicing compatibility among chips with large-volume requirements while minimizing reticle dimensions. Our mixed-integer linear programming models with VOCO are too complex to render good solutions for large test cases. Our B&ast;-tree with VOCO and HQ with VOCO use 16&percnt;&sim; 29&percnt; fewer wafers and 8&percnt;&sim; 19&percnt; less reticle area than the hierarchical quadrisection (HQ) method proposed by Kahng et al.
