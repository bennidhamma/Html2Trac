This directory contains HTML test files and the supposed output
html2xhtml should produce for them (compressed in
reference.tar.gz). In order to run these tests, type:

$ make test

or

$ ./test.sh

Each HTML file is processed once for each document type supported y
html2xhtml.

The script dumps the list of correct and failing tests. For tests that
fail, the script test_diff.sh shows the differences between the
reference file and the actual output of the program for every document
type. For example:

$ ./test_diff.sh test-utf8-count-1.html

After running the tests, the outputs of html2xhtml are in the
"tmp-test" directory and the references are in the "reference"
directory.

Finally, the directory can be cleaned up with:

$ make clean

or

$ ./test_clean.sh

NOTE: Tests that produce the output in UTF-16 may not currently work
properly, because two byte orderings are possible, but the reference
files use a specific byte ordering. The test system will be improved
to allow byte-order independent comparison.
